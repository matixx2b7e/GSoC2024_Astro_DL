Hi! I am Ye Li, a junior student in physics major from Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China. 

I have experience in several programming languages including Python, Java and C++ while Python is currently the most familiar one. From my previous projects in data processing, I gained much experience in Python and packages like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. For ML and DL, I usually use scikit-learn and PyTorch. 

### Experience in ML and DL

During the previous winter break, I worked on a classification problem on SDSS dataset. The goal is to classify observations into three groups: galaxies, stars, and quasars. The dataset was preprocessed by replacing abnormal values with mean and selecting important features including redshifts and flux in certain filters based on Pearson correlation coefficients. I tested several models including random forest, XGBoost, SVM, MLP, etc. and compared their accuracy and efficiency. 

Additionally, I have worked on a project on metaphor detection. I implemented a simple deep learning model with PyTorch which consists of a fine-tuned transformer model BERT and CNN layers. Although CNN is mainly designed for computer vision, it works with NLP as well. Since this is a binary classification problem, the activation function for this model is sigmoid function. I also added a drop layer to prevent overfitting.

Currently, I'm actively learning deep learning and optimization methods. I'm also taking part in a ML seminar on mathematics in machine learning algorithms.
